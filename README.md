# LEDBulbRemote
## An example sketch that cycles through an IR control function for cheap RGBW LED bulbs.

**Currenly only works with ones from Home Bargains.**

I'm using this in an IoT project to connect dumb bulbs to WiFi for use with Google assistant.

I've got a few different bulbs with different IR codes sitting around, so I might decode all the remotes and turn this into an RGWB LED Bulb remote library.

Uses [z3t0's library](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote) for sending IR codes.
